/**
 *  In JavaScript, objects are implemented as hash maps or dictionaries.
 * 
 * Object have no order
 * 
 *  lookup time for objects is O(1)
 * insert time for objects is O(1)
 * delete time for objects is O(1)
 * search time for objects is O(n)
 * 
 * Hence objects are preferred for these operations
 * 
 * hasownproperty() is O(1)
 * 
 * Object.keys() is O(n)
 * Object.values() is O(n)
 * Object.entries() is O(n)
 * 
 * List TC of all properties of Object
