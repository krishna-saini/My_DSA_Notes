## What is Linked list ?

A DS that contains a HEAD, a TAIL and a length property
A LL consists of nodes. Each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.
a node === |val|next|
There is no index. if we want to access something from middle, we start at the beginning.
Arrays are like elevator which can take you to any floor, while LL are like stairs. you have to start from floor 0.

HEAD is the first element of the list. TAIL is the last element of the list.
